Absolutely! Here is a detailed description of the **language style guide** I used to normalize your `README.md`. You can refer to this as:

** "Professional Technical README Style (PT-RS)"**

## **Language Style Guide: "Professional Technical README Style (PT-RS)"**

### **Tone**

* **Professional but accessible**: Written for engineers and technically literate readers, but avoids jargon overload.
* **Objective and clear**: Prioritizes facts and capabilities over hype or emotion.
* **Collaborative tone**: Recognizes team contributions and learning experiences without sounding overly informal.

### **Wording**

* Use of **active voice** where possible:

  * “We integrated OpenCV…” instead of “OpenCV was integrated…”
* Favor **concise, specific verbs**:

  * “Implemented”, “Integrated”, “Refactored”, “Generated”
  * Avoids vague terms like “thing”, “stuff”, “done”, etc.
* Each sentence communicates **one clear idea**.
* Sentences are revised to be **complete, grammatically correct**, and free of redundancy.

### **Vocabulary**

* **Technical and accurate**:

  * Uses correct terminology: “CMake linking”, “HSV thresholding”, “JNI bridge”, “real-time processing”
* Avoids **overly casual or conversational phrases** like:

  * “we figured this out”, “really cool”, “kind of”, “super fast”
* Includes **domain-specific clarity**:

  * E.g. “rob-twophase algorithm based on Kociemba's method”

## **Punctuation & Grammar**

* Uses **Oxford commas** for clarity in lists:

  * "code readability, modularity, and feedback"
* Ends all bullet points and feature descriptions with **periods**, maintaining sentence structure.
* Fixes improper contractions and informal phrasing:

  * “You attention to these details…” → “Your attention to these details…”
* Ensures **parallel structure** in lists:

  * All bullets start with a consistent verb form or noun phrase.

### **Structure and Formatting**

* Uses consistent section headers (`##`, `###`, `---`) to separate topics clearly.
* Provides **explicit explanations** after titles, avoiding assumptions.
* Each section follows a logical order:

  * Description → Problem → Goals → Tools → Design → Features → Architecture → Challenges → Lessons → Credits → Structure → Enhancements

### **Examples of Reformulations**

| Original                                                                             | Normalized                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “highs-peed robot”                                                                   | “high-speed robot”                                                               |
| “You attention to these details is greatly appreciated and have fun reading moment!” | “Your attention to these details is appreciated — enjoy exploring the project!”  |
| “As well as both algorithm being both optimized…”                                    | “In addition to both algorithms being highly optimized…”                         |
| “More specifically `opencv2/opencv.h` allows critical members functions…”            | “Specifically, `opencv2/opencv.h` enables access to essential OpenCV functions.” |

## Reference Name

If you'd like me to apply this same style again, you can simply say:

> “Use the **PT-RS style** for the README”
> or
> “Normalize this like the Rubik’s Cube robot README”

Would you like me to save this style as part of your profile so I always apply it to future README documents unless you specify otherwise?
